Group 62 Project for COMP2200, Semester 2, 2021, submitted by Nicholas Brennan (46030158) and Alexandra Ellison (45888949).

Our project focuses on implementing a range of machine learning methods to forecast the following day's rainfall for weather stations across NSW & ACT. We used models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Decision Trees. We were able to investigate the efficiency and reasonableness of these models for predicting rainfall.
